# OpenAI API Configuration
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here

# Development Notes:
# - Copy this file to .env and add your actual API key
# - This key is used as a fallback when no API key is manually entered
# - In production, use proper environment variable management
# - The VITE_ prefix makes it available to the client-side code
